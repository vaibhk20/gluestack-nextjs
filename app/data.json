      "content": "Let’s say you’re developing a React Native app for displaying a list of images from an API. In your application, you use an ImageGallery component to display a list of images. However, there is a problem with memory management in this component. In the above example, we use setInterval to increment the count variable every second. However, when the component is unmounted (no longer used), we forgot to clear the intervalId by not passing a cleanup function to useEffect. This can lead to a memory leak because setInterval is still running after the component has been unmounted. This can happen if a component is unmounted before useEffect runs for the first time. React Native Debugger is a powerful tool that supports React Native development. It integrates both React DevTools and Chrome DevTools, providing a comprehensive debugging experience. ",

      "description": "Detecting and Handling Memory Leaks in React Native Apps",
      "content": "My friends, as a software engineer, you must have used Event Emitter. We often use it to handle cross-component communication scenarios. It triggers an event that everyone can listen to, and it can send data when the event is triggered. Different libraries provide different implementations and are used for different purposes, but the basic idea is to provide a framework for publishing and subscribing to events. Do you want to know the magic behind it? This article will share with you a very simple solution to achieve it.",
